### ðŸ§  Neural Network Project
This project implements a neural network from scratch and applies it to two datasets: the MNIST digit dataset and a second dataset (MB_data_train.csv). The implementation includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
The project was developed as part of a machine learning course.

#### ðŸ§© Neural Network Implementation Structure
The neural network is implemented with the following components:
- Initialization: Weights are initialized using He initialization, and biases are initialized randomly.
- Activation Function: Sigmoid activation function is used.
- Cost Functions: Quadratic and Cross-Entropy cost functions are implemented.
- Feedforward: Computes the output of the network.
- Backpropagation: Updates the weights and biases using gradient descent.
- Training: Uses Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with mini-batch processing.
